# Router---EDA
In this research project, a Networks-on-Chip (NoC) Router will be structured, executed and tested that has It consists of four data input ports (datai1, datai2, datai3, datai4), four data output ports (datao1, datao2, datao3, datao4), four packet available indicators (Wr1, Wr2, Wr3, Wr4), a rclock (Clock), wclock (clock) and a rst (Reset) signal. Network on Chip (NoC) is an on-chip correspondence innovation in which countless handling components and storage blocks are incorporated on a solitary chip. Because of adaptability, versatile nature, well asset. NoCs utilization have gotten mainstream in and has proficiently supplanted SoCs.
